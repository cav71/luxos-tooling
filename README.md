# LuxOS Tools Repository

This repository contains scripts we built to operate and troubleshoot miners running LuxOS.

## LuxOS API Wrapper - luxos.py

This tool offers a convenient way to interact with LuxOS through a command-line interface (CLI) or as Python packages for more advanced integrations.

**CLI Usage**

The luxos.py script serves as a versatile LuxOS API wrapper, allowing users to interact with LuxOS features directly from the command line. Below are some basic examples:

```bash
python3 luxos.py --ipfile miners.csv --cmd rebootdevice --timeout 2
python3 luxos.py --range_start 192.168.1.0 --range_end 192.168.1.255 --cmd rebootdevice --verbose True
```

**Library Usage**

If you prefer to integrate LuxOS functionality into your Python applications or scripts, luxos.py can also be used as a Python package. Here's a quick example:

```python
from luxos import (execute_command)

execute_command('192.168.1.1', 4028, 2, 'rebootdevice', '', False)
```

## LuxOS HealthChecker - health_checker.py

The HealthChecker script is designed to continuously pull miner data from LuxOS, providing valuable insights into the health of your mining machines.

The HealthChecker uses poetry as a package manager, to install project dependencies run: `poetry install`. You can customize the HealthChecker params using the `config.yaml` file provided. Finally, to run the HealthChecker you can run: `poetry run python health_checker.py`.

## Development

### Initial setup
You need to create a new virtual env and install few packages in it:

```bash
# create a virtual env
python -m venv venv

# activate it
(dos)
.\venv\Scripts\activate
(*nix)
source ./venv/bin/activate

# install all packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# (otional) enable pre-commit
pre-commit install
```
### Development
Every time you restart a shell/cmd.exe:

```bash
# activate the virtual env
(for dos)
.\venv\Scripts\activate
(for *nix)
source ./venv/bin/activate
```
And that's all, happy coding!
